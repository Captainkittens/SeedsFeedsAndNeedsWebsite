        <h2>This is what we're doing..</h2>
        
        <p>A startup starting from Edmonton, Alberta, a next generation cooperative.</p>
        
        <p>In business chatter, it would be building a vertically, and horizontally, 
        integrated sets of parallel systems intended to produce social justice and produce.</p>
        
        <p>What we're trying to really do is have some fun, build a great community, and
          try our best to make a positive difference.</p>
        
        <p>We're selecting agriculture as one of our first large scale projects to
          tackle and have so far made undoubtable progress.</p>
        
        <p>We have over a hundred active members looking to discover a new way to 
          become more self reliant and grow.</p>
          
        <h2>What we've accomplished so far..</h2>
        
        <p title="For all the work you compose in your life. Only half of it will ever be written down. The other half exist as great pieces saved between the pages. Ideas in the mind forever preserved in the fleeting moment of their own perfection. An instance only appreciated within the brief intimacy that comes when our souls connect to something greater.">
          Originating as a group of strong-willed individuals who collected themselves together into 
          an anachronistic self-supportive community, this cooperative began in 2012 as the
          <a href="occupy.html">Occupy Camp</a> in Edmonton.</p> 
        
        <p title="Broken wings of a dove that cannot fly. A flight of beauty only to be witnessed from the ground. One day you will fly little bird, whether it be in this life or the next.">
          After that camp got, erhmm, crushed, by EPS. (right or wrong?, at this point.. w/e..)</p>
        
        <p title="Laughter on the high bridge help to deter the sharpened thoughts of the stones below. In a jest shared between peers of others, the clown works or talks the joker off his lonely stage. Ha hee ha.">
          So some shout outs were made, we walked the high level bridge, and more. 'Listen up!
          There is a huge assortment of issues plaguing us today! Imagine the exponential growth
          quotient if only we could dedicate a small bit of your time in order to work together! 
          Please consider that ever sway away is setting unwelcome precident. Horay/Yipee/Woohoo for education!.'
          </p>
        
        <p title="The only face that exists for me now is the one painted by the swirls of problems that encircle my quite quiet mind. Notes no longer sung by the choir. They come jeering our from the audience in vicious howls that form a horrendous malady. The conductor cowers as the stage lights go down. The show is over now and once rueful cries that filled my mind are replaced by blissful silence. Nothingness in a life forgotten. Impossible encores that the Artist may never perform.">
          So things obviously had to take a new direction, and so started
          the beginning Seeds Feeds and Needs, the cooperative.</p>
        
        <p title="Silent moments of transparency emanate between the notes and combine to form the orchestra of awkward. It sprays the audience like a shit mist of despair. They smile outward as they drown quietly from within, suffocated by the hums of mediocratic goodbyes.">
          Basic foundations of the cooperative were established when we began 
          as resellers of high quality organic produce. </p>
          
        <p>With only the greatest thanks to the folks who allowed us to its use,
          <!-- Good Note Farms --> a small test field for direct procurement was established.</p>
        
        <p>Many lessons were learned and in the end, a yield was harvested, and was distribruted,
          and now the next season is starting.</p>
